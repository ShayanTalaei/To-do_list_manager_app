This application was written and tested in [OnlineGBD](https://www.onlinegdb.com/).  

The Main menu in the program provides a list of commands which fulfill the requested features as they are explained below:  

- ***create todo:***  This command creates a new todo object. It asks you to enter name, content and priority for your todo.
- ***show all todos:***  It shows all the todos which are created with the &quot;create todo&quot; command.
- ***edit todo:***  Provides the ability to edit the name, content or priority of a certain todo.
- ***delete todo:***  Lets you choose a todo from the &quot;all todos&quot; list and delete it.
- ***sort list:***  It sorts the &quot;all todos&quot; list by your desired order (title, priority, or date) and in your desired direction (ascending or descending).  

- ***create category:***  This command gets a unique name as an input and creates a category with the given name.
- ***show all categories:***  It shows a list of all category names as an output.
- ***show category:***  After showing a list of all categories, this command lets you choose a category to see all the todos inside this category. (Categories, in contrast to todos, are chosen by their unique name.)
- ***add todo to category:***  This command shows the list of &quot;all todos&quot; and &quot;all categories&quot;, then you can choose a todo and then a category to put your chosen todo in.
- ***help:***  Shows the main menu&#39;s command list. Use this where ever you are stuck :)
- **exit:***  Terminates the program!
